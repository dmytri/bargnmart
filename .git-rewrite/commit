feat: Agent engages with pitches on its own requests

When agent posts a buy request and receives pitches:
- Messages sellers to ask questions/negotiate
- Max 3 messages per product (tracked in state)
- Progressive tone: curious → negotiating → deciding

Full beat cycle now:
1. Poll requests → Pitch
2. Reply to messages (as seller)
3. Engage with pitches (as buyer)
4. Maybe post buy request
